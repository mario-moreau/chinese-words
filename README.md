# chinese-words
A list of chinese words I got to find throughout my mandarin learning journey.
These words come from YouTube or Bilibili videos, Netflix series, Clozemaster sentences and also from chinese friends! :-)

## Intent
I initially created that list so that it could be directly imported in my Anki's chinese deck.
This could probably be imported in other programs as well.

## Potential improvements
- Pinyin will eventually be added, once I figure out how to have it displayed in a neat way in the Anki app.
- When the list eventually becomes too large, I will split it into multiple files based on categories (e.g.:chemical elements, body parts, colors,etc...)

## Disclaimer
That list might (and definitely will) occasionally include swear words, so don't feel offended about it.
